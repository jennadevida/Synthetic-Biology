# Synthetic Biology Project: Diffusion of Signals Between Bacterias
This is the repository for a Synthetic Biology proyect, in which we test the diffusion of signals between E.Coli colonies in a LB medium.

## Introduction

We are planning to understand the diffusion of a protein HCL-C6 added to a plate with a filter paper by measuring the fluorescence produced by a gene with a regulated promoter with exactly HCL-C6 as a inducer. In that way, HCL-C6 is a signal sent from the filter paper and received and expressed by our bacteria.

By also taking time laps tests of the bacteria without any signal and different concentrations of it, we should able to calculate the different concentrations in each time, calculating the fluorescence protein synthesis rate, signal concentration and the diffusion constant.
